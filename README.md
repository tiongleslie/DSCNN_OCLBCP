# Periocular in the wild: Dual-stream CNN and OC-LBCP


### Introduction
This work contributes a novel descriptor OC-LBCP and Dual-stream CNN for periocular in the wild.

We also provide the codes as follows:
  1) OC-LBCP (see [OC-LBCP](https://github.com/tiongleslie/DSCNN_OCLBCP/tree/master/OC-LBCP))
  2) Pre-trained model of Dual-stream CNN for periocular in the wild (see [DSCNN](https://github.com/tiongleslie/DSCNN_OCLBCP/tree/master/DSCNN))



### Pre-trained Model
