# Periocular in the wild: Dual-stream CNN and OC-LBCP


### Introduction
This work contributes a novel descriptor OC-LBCP and Dual-stream CNN for periocular in the wild.

We also provide the codes as follows:
  1) OC-LBCP (see [OC-LBCP](https://github.com/tiongleslie/crystal-structure-classification/tree/master/OC-LBCP))
  2) Pre-trained model of Dual-stream CNN (see [DSCNN](https://github.com/tiongleslie/crystal-structure-classification/tree/master/DSCNN))


### Compatibility
We tested the codes with:
  1) Tensorflow-GPU 1.13.1 under Ubuntu OS 18.04 LTS and Anaconda3 (Python 3.7)
  2) Tensorflow-GPU 1.13.1/Tensorflow 1.13.1 under Windows 10 and Anaconda3 (Python 3.7)


### Requirements
  1) [Anaconda3](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)
  2) [TensorFlow-GPU 1.13.1 or Tensorflow 1.13.1](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip)
  3) [PIL](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/pillow)
  4) [SciPy](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/scipy)
  5) [Matplotlib](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/matplotlib)
  6) [Numpy 1.16.4](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/1.16.4/)
